# Test 1 requirements.

## A4988 stepper driver module.

- Reduces the number of pins required to control from the microcontroller to just two (built-in translator).
- Has output capacity of +-2A which is enough to drive the stepper motor included.
- Eliminates the need for a complex microcontroller.

## Arduino UNO.
- For initial testing of individual stepper motors, the number of pins in UNO would be sufficient.
---
## Capacitor (47uf-100uf)
- protects driver from voltage spikes.
---
## 12V power supply
- As, the driver requires a minimum of 8v-35v.
---
## Potentiometer
- For grunt testing.
